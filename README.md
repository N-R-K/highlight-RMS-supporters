# Know your frens! Highlight RMS supporters in a frenly green color!

This userscript (badly) highlights those who have signed the [RMS Support letter](https://github.com/rms-support-letter/rms-support-letter.github.io)

I am by no means a web developer, I threw this together as an learning experiment in GitHub workflows so it probably doesn't work that well

All it does is load an external stylesheet from this repo that is auto-generated from the list of signed names.

The stylesheet is rather large (~75kb) but your browser should cache it after one transfer so it's not a big deal.

Commits and PRs are very welcome :)
